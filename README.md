# Lighthouse Merge F2F

This repository contains various resources used by the Lighthouse team for the
Merge F2F in October 2021.

## M2

The directories starting with `m2_` are reproducible examples of Lighthouse
meeting the M2 milestone.

The `m2_lighthouse` directory contains scripts required to run Lighthouse for
all the M2 testnets.

The `m2_<EL-team>` directories contain instructions for running the M2 milstone
for Lighthouse and that client team.

For example, to run "M2 Lighthouse/Geth", go to `m2_geth` and follow the readme
there.
